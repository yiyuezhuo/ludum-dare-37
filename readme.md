Oh... I don't have completed it again. However, I have completed the "engine". I want to fill some interesting and image into it. But I haven't time...

Anyway, my first design idea is based on the concept about the "multivariable normal distribution". In the model, if the "correlation coefficient" or "covariance" in two character is big. Then the two character tend to both big or both small. I want to give player ability to control these attribute. I don't see who try to practice before. It bring a excited fancy picture how game event system run (But it require huge events chain to implement the idea. I only write few event to test whether it can run.) with the special random way.

background story

The one room is history room. In sometime, by unknow rule, few people are sampled from the realworld. They live in the room temporarily. They encounter eachother and happend some event. Then, they are send back to real world and be "seed" to reboot it. The world will be more alike "seed".  You , the soul of the room, have power to kill some sampled people or interference their event result to construct new world. It is not vrey fast, but you can repeat and repeat to arrival the ideal world.

game control

The matrix lied on the page bottom are expect vector, delta expect vector, variance vector, delta variance vector, correlation matrix, delta correlation matrix (I don't prodive covariance matrix to show, because it can be computed by variance vector and correlation matrix easily and itself is a little clumsy to understand.).

The data list in the right is people lived in the room (per row represents one of them). You can kill some or change these attribute by control event result.

Click data list header can sort data.

To prevent you waste time to repeat and repeat. Now ,the game have only 6 events (I plan to design 600+! But not the time...).
